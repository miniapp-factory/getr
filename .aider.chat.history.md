#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

I need to edit the app metadata file to set the new title and description, and create a new logo‑generation todo file.  
Please add the current `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` file to the chat so I can propose the exact changes.

A vibrant logo featuring the word 'Getr' in bold modern font, with a stylized coupon symbol integrated into the lettering, set against a clean white background. The logo should have a subtle gradient from light blue to dark blue, with the coupon symbol in a contrasting orange color to emphasize the discount theme. The overall design is minimalistic yet eye-catching, suitable for a mobile app and website header.
